# Channel Burndown List

In the case of a restricted-time migration, it might be necessary to omit some channels from archival. This page contains a table that attempt to prioritize channels in order of importance with some notes. 

This table is only my oppinion, and may change. 

1. Berk - The MAIN channel. If we had to take only one, it would be this one. It is the largest by far.
2. httyd-general - Our main fandom channel. Lots of important lore in here
3. fandom-meetup-plans - Small channel, but lots of important meetup messages and photos.
4. dragons_edge - Secondary chat channel. Important, but less so. Smaller.
5. media_spoilers - Contains httyd lore for movie releases and things
6. nerds - Lots of good techie discussions. May be useful for reference
7. art-and-stuff - Very nice to have **if media can be saved**. Not much use without media. Lots of original art. 
8. non-httyd-general - Other fandoms lore chat 
9. book_spoilers - New and small channel, has some fandom discussion 
10. ebay - Good discussion and links to merch, **more useful with media**.
11. nsfw - Lots of funny discussion in here, but not super important
12. games - Some game discussion, meh
13. language-talks - Small discussion channel
14. tumblrs-and-social-media - Small channel, mostly links
15. music - Some old music discussion, mostly links nowadays
16. random-gifs-photos - Mostly **media**, lots of memes and such
17. random_videos - Mostly YouTube links
18. voice-chat-live - Messages, but mostly nonsense from VCs that we don't understand or remember anymore
19. fandom-dates - Birthday messages
20. emotional_support - This is complicated. A lot of users may not want this moved, and I don't blame them. As a result, not high priority 
21. tales-of-xadia - Dead, small channel
22. nsfw-spoilers - Dead channel
23. Hidden and mod channels - No idea what is in these
24. Archived channels - Do we even look at these now? Some lore importance
